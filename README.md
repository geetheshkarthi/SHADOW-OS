## 🎯 About the Project

Shadow OS helps users move from their **current career state** to a **desired future role** using autonomous AI agents.

Key highlights:
- Resume-evidence-based skill verification
- Role-aware gap analysis
- Multi-phase adaptive roadmap generation
- Continuous evaluation through feedback loops

---

## 🚀 Opportunity

Most career platforms provide static suggestions and generic learning paths. Shadow OS addresses this gap by introducing **agentic intelligence** that actively reasons, plans, evaluates, and adapts career strategies over time.

---

### 🚀 Running the Project

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the backend server:
```bash
python main.py
```

3. Open the user interface in a browser:
```bash
http://localhost:8000/ui/index.html
```

## ⚖ Ethical Considerations

- No automated job applications  
- No web scraping  
- No placement guarantees  
- No permanent user data storage  
- Decision-support system only  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Shadow OS demonstrates how **agentic AI systems** can be applied to real-world career development. By combining autonomous reasoning, adaptive planning, and explainable decisions, it moves beyond traditional recommendation engines and showcases intelligent career convergence.

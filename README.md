## 🎯 About the Project

Shadow OS helps users move from their **current career state** to a **desired future role** using autonomous AI agents.

Key highlights:
- Resume-evidence-based skill verification
- Role-aware gap analysis
- Multi-phase adaptive roadmap generation
- Continuous evaluation through feedback loops

---

## 🚀 Opportunity

Most career platforms provide static suggestions and generic learning paths. Shadow OS addresses this gap by introducing **agentic intelligence** that actively reasons, plans, evaluates, and adapts career strategies over time.
